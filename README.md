# Installer-4
Installer 4, an iPhoneOS 2 Package Manager which compiles and runs on modern iOS

This version of Installer 4 should compile and run as is on any modern iOS version. Please keep in mind that none of the UI was updated and so it looks 'wrong' at best, and downright broken at worst.

Most of the code has not been touched since early 2008, it was only updated (3 years ago) to support compiling on recent iOS versions.

Only active repository is the default one, but is limited to certain iOS versions. Let me know on Twitter and I will add your iOS version.

### Disclaimer

USE AT OWN RISK. Installation of packages in Installer 4 has not been updated since iPhoneOS 2 (2008) and could cause issues!

This is merely being released as a fun project & as a nostalgic boost for me. It cannot and should not be used for anything serious. I just want to keep the old 2008 era project alive.
